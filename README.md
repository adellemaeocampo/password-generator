# password-generator

## Description

In thjis project we were given the task to create a website that generates a random password. This sitewas built to allow users to generate a random password with a length, choosen by them, and multiple types of characters to their choosing. This site resolves the stress of people having to create a password themselves and generates a strong enough password providing security. During the making of this site I was able to apply mu knowledge in Javascript, HTML and CSS deepening my knowledge in these fields, especially in javascript, conditions, for-loops and in-build-functions.
